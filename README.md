## 📁 App Routes & Load Sizes

| Route                    | Size    | First Load JS |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------ |
| `/`                      | 195 B   | 152 kB        |
| `/\_not-found`           | 977 B   | 101 kB        |
| `/api/uploadthing`       | 136 B   | 101 kB        |
| `/dashboard`             | 12.9 kB | 166 kB        |
| `/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]` | 342 B   | 131 kB        |
| `/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]` | 342 B   | 131 kB        |
| `/summaries/[id]`        | 806 B   | 157 kB        |
| `/upload`                | 29.8 kB | 180 kB        |

**Shared JS (First Load)**: 100 kB

* `chunks/4bd1b696-2819ba7e833f89f2.js`: 53.2 kB
* `chunks/684-d8bbcd2add0176ac.js`: 45.2 kB

## 🧩 How It Works

1.  **User Authentication**: Users can sign up or log in using Clerk.
2.  **PDF Upload**: Authenticated users can upload PDF documents through the `/upload` page.
3.  **Storage & Processing**: UploadThing handles the file uploads. The PDFs are stored and processed.
4.  **AI Summary**: Langchain reads the uploaded PDF, generates a simplified and structured summary.
5.  **View Summaries**: Summaries are accessible via the `/dashboard` and individual `/summaries/[id]` routes.
